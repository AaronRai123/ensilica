# Ensilica

## AI-Powered Genetic Construct Designer

Ensilica is an advanced tool for designing genetic constructs using AI. It processes natural language descriptions to generate genetic constructs, design PCR primers, and create laboratory protocols.

## Features

- Design genetic constructs using component selection or natural language descriptions
- Generate optimal PCR primers with restriction site adapters
- Create detailed laboratory protocols
- Analyze constructs for potential issues and expression predictions
- Perform restriction site analysis for cloning strategies
- Visualize constructs with detailed plasmid maps
